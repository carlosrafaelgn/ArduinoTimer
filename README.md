ArduinoTimer
============

ArduinoTimer is a library, which aims at providing developers with means to schedule asynchronous timer execution, pretty much like timer services provided by real OSes. In fact, it is a set of libraries, one for each timer available in ATmega2560 (1, 3, 4 and 5). By dividing the full library into four smaller libraries, the developer can save both RAM and Flash memory. The file ArduinoTimer.zip is a convenience for downloading all files at once :)

**You can download ArduinoTimer library in a single zip file using the following links: [Timer1](https://github.com/carlosrafaelgn/ArduinoTimer/blob/master/Timer1.zip?raw=true), [Timer3](https://github.com/carlosrafaelgn/ArduinoTimer/blob/master/Timer3.zip?raw=true), [Timer4](https://github.com/carlosrafaelgn/ArduinoTimer/blob/master/Timer4.zip?raw=true) and [Timer5](https://github.com/carlosrafaelgn/ArduinoTimer/blob/master/Timer5.zip?raw=true)!**

**The only library which contains examples is Timer1. Hence, if you download libraries Timer3, Timer4 or Timer5, but you do not download library Timer1, you will have no examples to work with!**

Library Timer1 can be used with ATmega2560, ATmega168 and with ATmega328. Nevertheless, libraries Timer3, Timer4 and Timer5 are exclusive to ATmega2560.

Each library has nine functions:
- void startTimer#(unsigned long microsecondsInterval): Starts the timer, and schedules the first notification. On 16 MHz Arduino boards, this function has a resolution of 4us, for intervals <= 262000, a resolution of 16us for intervals <= 1048000, and a resolution of 64us for intervals <= 4194000. On 8 MHz Arduino boards, this function has a resolution of 8us, for intervals <= 524000, a resolution of 32us for intervals <= 2097000, and a resolution os 128us for intervals <= 8388000. 
- void startCountingTimer#(): Starts the timer, but does not schedule any notifications. On 16 MHz Arduino boards, the timer has a resolution of 4us. On 8 MHz Arduino boards, the timer has a resolution of 8us. In other words, the value returned by readTimer#() should be multiplied either by 4 ou by 8 to get the actual amount of microseconds. The value returned by readTimer#() resets approximately every 262ms on 16 MHz boards, and every 524ms on 8 MHz boards.
- void startSlowCountingTimer#(): Starts the timer, but does not schedule any notifications. On 16 MHz Arduino boards, the timer has a resolution of 16us. On 8 MHz Arduino boards, the timer has a resolution of 32us. In other words, the value returned by readTimer#() should be multiplied either by 16 ou by 32 to get the actual amount of microseconds. The value returned by readTimer#() resets approximately every 1048ms on 16 MHz boards, and every 2097ms on 8 MHz boards.
- void startUltraSlowCountingTimer#(): Starts the timer, but does not schedule any notifications. On 16 MHz Arduino boards, the timer has a resolution of 64us. On 8 MHz Arduino boards, the timer has a resolution of 128us. In other words, the value returned by readTimer#() should be multiplied either by 64 ou by 128 to get the actual amount of microseconds. The value returned by readTimer#() resets approximately every 4194ms on 16 MHz boards, and every 8388ms on 8 MHz boards.
- void resetTimer#(): Resets the timer's counter. This function should be called as soon as a notification is received, in order to properly prepare the timer for the next notification.
- void resetTimer#Unsafe(): A much faster version of the above function, but this one requires interrupts to be disabled.
- void pauseTimer#(): Pauses the timer, halting the counting and thus, preventing any further notifications.
- void resumeTimer#(): Resumes the timer.
- unsigned int readTimer#(): Returns the current value of the timer's counter.
- unsigned int readTimer#Unsafe(): A much faster version of the above function, but this one requires interrupts to be disabled.

Where # is 1, 3, 4 or 5, depending on the chosen library.

There are also four other functions common to all libraries:
- void disableMillis(): Disables Arduino's default millisecond counter, rendering millis(), micros(), delay() and delayMicroseconds() useless, while saving some processing power.
- void enableMillis(): Enables Arduino's default millisecond counter.
- xxx microsFromCounting(x): Returns the amount of microseconds in x (refer to Example 2 for sample usage and bear in mind this is a macro, not an actual function, therefore the return type is not defined).
- xxx microsFromSlowCounting(x): Returns the amount of microseconds in x - only to be used when the timer was started with startSlowCountingTimer#() (refer to Example 3 for sample usage and bear in mind this is a macro, not an actual function, therefore the return type is not defined).
- xxx microsFromUltraSlowCounting(x): Returns the amount of microseconds in x - only to be used when the timer was started with startUltraSlowCountingTimer#() (bear in mind this is a macro, not an actual function, therefore the return type is not defined).

Functions resetTimer#, pauseTimer#, resumeTimer#, disableMillis, enableMillis, microsFromCounting, microsFromSlowCounting and microsFromUltraSlowCounting are actually implemented as macros for better performance.

In order to receive the notifications, an interrupt handler must be setup as shown below:

``` c++
ISR(timer#Event)
{
  resetTimer#();
  // Handler code
}
```

Timers and PWM (analogWrite)
----------------------------

When using the timers, a few PWM outputs (analogWrite) are disabled depending on the timer used.

ATmega168, ATmega328:
- Using Timer 1 disables PWM (analogWrite) on pins 9 and 10

ATmega2560:
- Using Timer 1 disables PWM (analogWrite) on pins 11 and 12
- Using Timer 3 disables PWM (analogWrite) on pins 2, 3 and 5
- Using Timer 4 disables PWM (analogWrite) on pins 6, 7 and 8
- Using Timer 5 disables PWM (analogWrite) on pins 44, 45 and 46

Example 1 - TimerBlinking
-------------------------
``` c++
#include <Timer1.h>

// Pin 13 has a LED connected on most Arduino boards
#define LED 13
byte ledState;

void setup()
{
  ledState = 0;
  
  // Disable Arduino's default millisecond counter (from now on, millis(), micros(),
  // delay() and delayMicroseconds() will not work)
  disableMillis();
  
  // Prepare Timer1 to send notifications (interrupts) every 1000000us (1s)
  // On 16 MHz Arduino boards, this function has a resolution of 4us for intervals <= 260000,
  // and a resolution of 16us for other intervals
  // On 8 MHz Arduino boards, this function has a resolution of 8us for intervals <= 520000,
  // and a resolution of 32us for other intervals
  startTimer1(1000000L);
  
  // Configure the led pin as an output
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
}

// Define the function which will handle the notifications (interrupts)
ISR(timer1Event)
{
  // Reset Timer1 (resetTimer1 should be the first operation for better timer precision)
  resetTimer1();
  // For a smaller and faster code, the line above could safely be replaced with a call
  // to the function resetTimer1Unsafe() as, despite its name, it IS safe to call
  // that function in here (interrupts are disabled)
  
  // Make sure to do your work as fast as possible, since interrupts are automatically
  // disabled when this event happens (refer to interrupts() and noInterrupts() for
  // more information on that)
  
  // Toggle led's state
  ledState ^= 1;
  digitalWrite(LED, ledState);
}
```

Example 2 - TimerCounting
-------------------------
``` c++
#include <Timer1.h>

unsigned short lastTickCount;

void setup()
{
  // Disable Arduino's default millisecond counter (from now on, millis(), micros(),
  // delay() and delayMicroseconds() will not work)
  disableMillis();
  
  // Prepare Timer1 to count
  // On 16 MHz Arduino boards, this function has a resolution of 4us
  // On 8 MHz Arduino boards, this function has a resolution of 8us
  startCountingTimer1();
  
  // Initialize our counter
  lastTickCount = readTimer1();
}

void loop()
{
  // readTimer1() returns a maximum value of 65535
  // That means the maximum possible delta one can measure with this
  // function (when in counting mode) is 262ms on 16 MHz boards,
  // and 524ms on 8 MHz boards
  unsigned short currentTickCount = readTimer1();
  unsigned short delta = currentTickCount - lastTickCount;
  lastTickCount = currentTickCount;
  
  // If you estimate deltaMicros could be > 65 ms, or 65535 us,
  // delta should be cast to unsigned long, and deltaMicros should be
  // created as an unsigned long variable
  // For example: unsigned long deltaMicros = microsFromCounting((unsigned long)delta);
  unsigned short deltaMicros = microsFromCounting(delta);
  
  // Do your work here
}
```

Example 3 - TimerMillisWithoutInterrupts
-------------------------------------------
``` c++
#include <Timer1.h>

unsigned short lastTickCount;
unsigned short myMicros;
unsigned long myMillis;

void setup()
{
  // Disable Arduino's default millisecond counter (from now on, millis(), micros(),
  // delay() and delayMicroseconds() will not work)
  disableMillis();
  
  // Prepare Timer1 to count
  // On 16 MHz Arduino boards, this function has a resolution of 4us
  // On 8 MHz Arduino boards, this function has a resolution of 8us
  startCountingTimer1();
  
  // Initialize our counters
  lastTickCount = readTimer1();
  myMicros = 0;
  myMillis = 0;
  
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop()
{
  // readTimer1() returns a maximum value of 65535
  // That means the maximum possible delta one can measure with this
  // function is 262ms on 16 MHz boards, and 524ms on 8 MHz boards
  unsigned short currentTickCount = readTimer1();
  unsigned short delta = currentTickCount - lastTickCount;
  lastTickCount = currentTickCount;
  
  // If you estimate deltaMicros could be > 65 ms, or 65535 us,
  // delta should be cast to unsigned long, and deltaMicros should be
  // created as an unsigned long variable
  // For example: unsigned long deltaMicros = microsFromCounting((unsigned long)delta);
  unsigned short deltaMicros = microsFromCounting(delta);
  
  // Update our micro and millis counters
  myMicros += deltaMicros;
  while (myMicros >= 1000)
  {
    myMicros -= 1000;
    myMillis++;
  }
  
  // Do your work here
  
  Serial.println(myMillis);
}
```
